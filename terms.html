        <h2>1. About Sold Financial</h2>
        <p><span class="kbd">Sold Financial</span> is a trading name of <strong>Homei Fi Pty Ltd</strong> (ABN 26 691 328 499). Homei Fi Pty Ltd is a Credit Representative (No. <strong>573517</strong>) authorised under Australian Credit Licence No. <strong>486112</strong> held by Purple Circle Financial Services Pty Ltd. References to “we”, “us” or “our” mean Homei Fi Pty Ltd trading as Sold Financial.</p>

        <h2>2. Purpose of this site</h2>
        <p>This site helps you begin the home loan process digitally. You can complete a fact find, view indicative options and, if you choose, verify information via Open Banking so a credit representative can assess suitability and provide a personalised recommendation.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Collect self reported details about income, expenses, property and preferences.</li>
          <li>Generate indicative comparisons of current lender offers from our panel.</li>
          <li>Enable secure, read only Open Banking verification when you are ready.</li>
          <li>Allow a licensed representative to conduct a suitability review and make a final recommendation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. No credit check or approval at this stage</h2>
        <p>Completing our questions does not involve a credit check and does not constitute a credit application or approval. Any estimates or indicative offers shown rely on the information you provide and may change after verification and full assessment against lender credit criteria.</p>

        <h2>4. Information accuracy</h2>
        <p>Please ensure information you provide is true, complete and current. Indicative results rely on self reported data until you complete Open Banking verification. We may contact you to clarify information before any recommendation is made.</p>

        <h2>5. Open Banking data</h2>
        <p>If you choose to connect accounts, we use <strong>Frollo Pty Ltd</strong>, a Consumer Data Right accredited data recipient, to collect read only financial data with your consent. Data is used only for credit assessment and compliance, and handled in line with our <a class="underline" href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Connections are secure, read only and cannot make payments.</li>
          <li>Your consent can be withdrawn at any time and will expire after the stated period.</li>
          <li>We will only request data that is reasonably necessary for credit assessment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. How recommendations are provided</h2>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-5">
          <li><strong>Digital fact find</strong> — you share self reported details and receive indicative options.</li>
          <li><strong>Data verification</strong> — with your consent we verify income, expenses and liabilities using Open Banking.</li>
          <li><strong>Suitability assessment</strong> — a credit representative reviews your objectives, financial situation and needs, may speak with you to confirm details, and if appropriate issues written documents such as a Credit Quote and Credit Proposal Disclosure before any application is submitted.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>No formal recommendation or credit assistance is provided until all three steps are completed.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of information</h2>
        <p>Content on this site is general and does not take your personal objectives, financial situation or needs into account. You should not rely on indicative information as financial advice or a loan offer. Formal credit assistance is only provided once you receive and accept written documentation from a Sold Financial representative.</p>

        <h2>8. Fees and commissions</h2>
        <p>There is no charge to use this website. If you proceed with a loan arranged through Sold Financial, we may receive commission payments from the lender. We will disclose fees, commissions and any other benefits in writing before you accept a recommendation.</p>

        <h2>9. Privacy and data handling</h2>
        <p>We comply with the <em>Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)</em> and the Consumer Data Right Rules. For details about how we collect, use and store personal information, please read our <a class="underline" href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>10. Liability</h2>
        <p>To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any loss arising from use of this website or reliance on indicative estimates prior to full assessment. Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under the Australian Consumer Law.</p>

        <h2>11. Governing law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia. By using this website you submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Victoria.</p>
